## Game Play

Gameplay is designed to be fast and exciting. Attacks are not designed to instant kill, with users having longer fights with each other. When users meet, there should be a flurry of abilities used by both in attempts to eliminate each other. Players have 100 health, and there will be cooldowns (most of the time fractions of a second) on abilities to prevent matches from being decided by CPS. 

## Gamemodes

**Team Versuses**
3 minute match, where teams try to eliminate the other players as much as possible. Teams get one point for each opponent eliminated, with a 3 second respawn (will need a check to make sure spawnkilling is not an avalible option). At the end, the team with the most points wins.

**Capture the Pencil**
Teams have a pencil next to their spawn, which the other teams comes to try and steal and take back to their spawn. Both teams can see the location and status (stolen or not) of both pencils.

**Elimination**
Five rounds of no respawn matches, teams win rounds by eliminating all other opponents. Winner of more rounds wins.

## Playable Characters

Each department has a few primary abililities, with specific teachers having 1 to 2 unique abilities. The unqiue abilities are designed to be much stronger than the generic abilities.

## User Interface

**Start Menu**
Users start on a starting menu, with five options. In the middle is a queue button, which allows them to ready up for a game. In the settings button, they can change settings such as the volume, game quality, change keybinds, and other essential options. The character viewer button allows them to view the different characters so they can see their abilities before playing. A friends button lets them add a view their friends in game. Then finally, there is another button for them to see game stats (KDR, WLR, etc).

**Readying Up**
When they hit ready to queue, they get to choose which character they want to play as, as well as choose to ready up with friends so they will be put on the same team. It will then keep them readying up until they are put into a game.

**Entering and Leaving Games**
When the user is put into a game, they get spawned into the gamemode they are playing immediately. A countdown will then signal the start of the game, where they tehn take control of their character and immediately start playing. There ui should be pretty minimalist, with options for them to view their health and other essential features, as well as the game time. Once the game ends, there should be a leaderboard that pops up declaring the winner, as well as showing player performance. Afterwards, they are sent back to the start menu.

**Gameplay Interface**
Users should control their player with a keyboard and mouse (or trackpad), with the keyboard working control movement and some abliities, and the mouse for aiming and using basic abilities with the left click button. 

## Asthetics

This game will have a 2d pixelated theme, with bright colors and contrast. Abilities in particular should contrast very easily with the background, to make it clear when a ability is being used and so users can tell which ability it may be. The user interface should be very easy to use, and will be bland compared to the game itself. Users will then be more motivated to play the game instead of staring a the menus.
